    Hello! My name is Abdelrahman. 
    I try to optimize every process I encounter. 
    In other words, my job is to find ways to do existing tasks in a more (sometimes dramatically) efficient way.
    To that end, I study the role of historical data in making better optimization decisions.
    
    This blog navigates a variety of topics that Iâ€™ve come across in my journey as a student.
    Although most of the writing is to confirm that I understand something, I hope that it would help someone out there in their job.
